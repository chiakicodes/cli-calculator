# cli-calculator

A powerful command-line calculator that supports basic arithmetic operations, advanced functions, unit conversions, and history tracking. This tool allows users to evaluate mathematical expressions, view past calculations, and convert units between temperature, length, and weight.

## Features
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.
- **Advanced Functions**: Trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan), logarithms, square roots.
- **Unit Conversions**: Convert between temperature (Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin), length (meters, kilometers, miles), and weight (grams, kilograms, pounds).
- **History Tracking**: View past calculations.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chiakicodes/cli-calculator.git
   cd calculator

2. Run the calculator:
   ```bash
   python calculator.py

3. Input your expressions or select unit conversions.

## Examples

### Basic Operations:
   ```bash
   > 5 + 3
   8

### Advanced Functions:
   ```bash
   > sin(45)
   0.707

### Unit Conversions:
   ```bash
   > 100 km to miles
   62.1371 miles

### View History:
   ```bash
   > history
   5 + 3 = 8
   sin(45) = 0.707

## Installation
